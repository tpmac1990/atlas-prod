This could be by location, type, status or any of the other filter groups specified further down the page. On top of this, the user is able to filter the other dataset for related data. For example, a user could filter for all the mining titles in a specific region and then filter for all the active mines that lie within these titles. The resulting data can be viewed in map or table form, while more detailed data of an individual title or site is also easily accessible.
